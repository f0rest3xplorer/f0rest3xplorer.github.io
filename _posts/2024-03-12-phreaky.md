## Enumeration

For this challenge, we are just given a pcap (packet capture) file to download, along with the hint above. Let's open it up with wireshark and see what we can find.

There is a lot to go through in this pcap, but after searching through it for a while, I noticed that there were some emails being sent that appear to have password protected `.zip` files attached. It also tells us that it is a multi-part message.

## NetworkMiner

To make it easier to exctract these files, I'm going to switch over to another tool called [NetworkMiner](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2014-02&post=HowTo-install-NetworkMiner-in-Ubuntu-Fedora-and-Arch-Linux). If you open the pcap file and go to the "Messages" tab, you can see a list of all of the emails, the passwords in the messages, and the attachments.

If you right click on one of the attachemnts, you can click on "Show Folder" and it will bring up a finder window with all 15 `.zip` files along with the corresponding `.eml` files. If we try and open one of the `.zip` files, it prompts us for a password. My next step was to make a wordlist of the passwords contained in the emails to make my life a little easier and then unzip all 15 files.

## Using cat to combile the files

None of the files will open as they are right now. Since we know it was a multipart message, and each PDF filename contains a "part[1-15]", we need to combine the files back together into one file.

To do this we will use the `cat` command to concatenate all of the files:

```shell
┌──(f0rest3xplorer㉿kali)-[~/…/forensics/phreaky/zip files/SecureFile]
└─$ cat phreaks_plan.pdf.part* > combined_file.pdf  
```

## Flag!

Now we can open `combined_file.pdf` and we see our flag at the bottom of page 2!
